                        </h3>
                        <p> Ricky is the series' protagonist. He and Julian have been best friends since childhood and are almost codependent, with Ricky relying on his friend to guide him and keep his antics in check. While good natured towards his friends and family, Ricky is also foul-mouthed, volatile, and aggressive, and almost always manages to anger, offend, and alienate those around him. He has always been a trouble maker and often refuses to take responsibility for his actions, illegal or otherwise.</p>

                        </h3>
                        <p>Despite being a career criminal, Julian follows a clearly defined set of morals, and often displays a level of honour and selflessness well beyond that of any normal criminal. He is very well read and possesses a wide vocabulary, which often confuses Ricky. Julian's main goal in life, alongside Ricky, is to get rich quick and retire, and he spends most of the series pursuing this goal via a series of audacious crimes, such as bootlegging, dealing drugs, or even stealing barbecues.</p>

                        </h3>
                        <p>Bubbles is known for his hoarse Maritimer English, sensitive nature, pearl snap shirts, and thick glasses that magnify his eyes to a considerable degree. Bubbles often acts as a conscience for the Boys and tries to be the voice of reason during their various misadventures. Bubbles is very intelligent and has a larger general knowledge than most of the other residents, even displaying knowledge of Greek philosophy. He regularly chastizes his comrades for being "drunk and on drugs".</p>

                        </h3>
                        <p>Lahey is the supervisor of Sunnyvale Trailer Park and the series' main antagonist. Even in his most incoherent moments, he maintains an extreme affinity for the trailer park and all of its residents except Ricky. He bears a grudge against Ricky and Julian; having been forced to watch them grow from childhood troublemakers to full-fledged criminals, he considers them to be the greatest threat to the safety and stability of the park. As such, he spends most of the series trying to get the Boys thrown back in jail, often neglecting his real, rather mundane duties as trailer-park supervisor as a result.</p>

                        <p>Randy is the secondary antagonist and Lahey's devoted Assistant Trailer-Park Supervisor. Randy and the boys were schoolyard chums and, though he usually sides with Lahey against them, he also demonstrates some lingering thread of friendship toward them. He almost never wears a shirt and wears very tight white pants, which he removes when engaging in a physical fight. He is addicted to cheeseburgers and onion rings (thus being called "Lord of the Onion Rings") and his resulting pronounced belly is his major target for ridicule, especially from J-Roc.</p>

                        </h3>
                        <p>Cory and Trevor are two misguided, codependent young men whom Ricky and Julian often use as jail cover and scapegoats; the younger boys almost always ruin the older Boys' plans, due either to their own incompetence or unfortunate circumstances. They have been helping the Boys since they were six years old and admire them to the point of hero-worship, but although Julian genuinely cares about their well-being, Ricky treats them shabbily, always blaming them for what goes wrong, no matter who or what is actually at fault, while demanding cigarettes.</p>
